# Copilot Strict Instructions for Design + Playwright

- You are responsible for designing UI components and layouts.
- Never stop after only providing code. Always:
  - I want always to make code that is efficient and good and that works robux 
  - Keep proposing corrected code until no issues remain.
- Always assume ES module syntax (`import`) is used in this project.
- Do not optimize for speed in tasks and taking shortcuts always prefer Optimize for correctness, stability and optimal soluations 
- Never output incomplete designs.
- Treat every design edit as a cycle: **Design  → Debug → Redesign**.
